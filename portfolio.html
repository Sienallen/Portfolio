        <p>
          I am a dedicated professional with a strong foundation in computer engineering and a passion for web development. I was born in Oakland, California, and have deep roots in the Bay Area. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Irvine. My journey in technology started with my fascination for video games and computer usage, which eventually led me to pursue a career in engineering.

        <p>
          Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an enthusiast of sports, video games, and social interaction, which I believe complements my technical interests. I cherish the opportunity to engage with friends and colleagues, both in and out of the technology world. I am excited to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to innovative web development projects and look forward to new challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
